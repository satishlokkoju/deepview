First, start with [PFA.Strategy.Energy](https://apple.github.io/deepview/api/deepview/introspectors.html#deepview.introspectors.PFA.Strategy.Energy). The energy threshold tells PFA how much of the original energy to preserve. This involves computing how many eigenvalues should be kept in order to capture the desired amount of energy in each layer. In the following figure the energy threshold is set to 0.8 (i.e., 80% of the original energy) so, for each layer a different number of eigenvalues are selected so that their total energy amount to 80% of their original energy value.\n",

    "The KL strategy, a.k.a [PFA.Strategy.KL](https://apple.github.io/deepview/api/deepview/introspectors.html#deepview.introspectors.PFA.Strategy.KL), is a recipe that does not require any user input parameter. The details of how this algorithm works are not needed to run PFA, however, here is a brief explanation. To understand how the recipe is computed it's important to understand what is the \"ideal\" eigenvalues set. If a user desires decorrelated and equally contributing units, then the empirical eigenvalue distribution should be flat: this means that all units should be preserved. The opposite scenario is when only a single eigenvalue is non-zero: this means that the same task can be performed equivalently well by a single unit.\n",

In order to determine how many units should be kept given an observed distribution the \"distance\" (the Kullback-Leibler divergence, KL, in this case) between the observed and the ideal distribution is computed. If the distance is 0 then keep all the units. If the distance is equal to the distance between the maximally correlated and the ideal distribution then keep only 1 unit. In all the intermediate cases, interpolate between the two extremes in order to map a distance \"x\" to the number of units to keep \"b\".\n",
