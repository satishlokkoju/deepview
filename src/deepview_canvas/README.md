# Canvas

**Reusable, explorable, and sharable data science components**

Canvas is a framework for composing interactive machine learning interfaces with task-specific, data-driven components that can be used across platforms such as computational notebooks and web dashboards.

## Overview

Canvas enables data scientists and machine learning practitioners to create interactive, reusable components for ML model exploration and analysis. It provides a flexible architecture that works seamlessly across different platforms, from Jupyter notebooks to web applications.

This project is based on research presented in the paper ["Canvas: Composing Interactive Interfaces for Machine Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08946) at ACM CHI 2022.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build and compose reusable ML visualization components
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works in both Jupyter notebooks and web dashboards
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create dynamic, interactive ML model analysis tools
- **State Management**: Built-in state management for component coordination
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to create and integrate custom components
