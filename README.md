# DeepView: Advanced Machine Learning Model and Dataset Introspection Toolkit

DeepView is a powerful Python toolkit designed for comprehensive introspection and analysis of machine learning models and datasets. It provides a rich set of tools for understanding, visualizing, and debugging deep learning models and their training data.

> **Note**: This project is a fork of [Apple's DNIKit](https://github.com/apple/dnikit) (Data and Network Introspection Kit) under the Apache 2.0 License. While maintaining the core functionality, we've made significant modifications and improvements to better suit our specific needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Model Analysis
```python
'''
    Example directory structure:
    root_folder/
        class1/
            image1.jpg
            image2.jpg
        class2/
            image3.jpg
            image4.jpg

'''

dataset_path = '<Sample Dataset Path>'

from deepview_datasets import CustomDatasets
dataset_producer = CustomDatasets.ImageFolderDataset(root_folder=dataset_path,image_size=(224, 224))

# Chain together all operations around running the data through the model
model_stages = (
    mobilenet_preprocessor,
    
    ImageResizer(pixel_format=ImageFormat.HWC, size=(224, 224)),
    
    # Run inference with MobileNet and extract intermediate embeddings
    # (this time, just `conv_pw_130`, but other layers can be added)
    # :: Note: This auto-detects the input layer and connects up 'images' to it:
    mobilenet.model(requested_responses=['conv_pw_13']),
    
    Pooler(dim=(1, 2), method=Pooler.Method.MAX)
)

# Finally put it all together!
custom_producer = pipeline(
    # Original data producer that will yield batches
    dataset_producer,

    # unwrap the tuple of pipeline stages that contain model inference, and pre/post-processing
    *model_stages,

    # Cache responses to play around with data in future cells
    Cacher()
)

# The most time consuming, since all compute is done here
# Data passed through DeepView in batches to produce the backend data table that will be displayed by Canvas

no_familiarity_config = ReportConfig(
    familiarity=None,
)

# report = DatasetReport.introspect(
#    producer,
#    config=no_familiarity_config  # Comment this out to run the whole Dataset Report
#)

report = DatasetReport.introspect(
    custom_producer
)

print(report.data.head())

```
