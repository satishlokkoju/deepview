## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Basic Model Analysis
```python
import deepview
from deepview_torch import TorchModel

# Load and analyze a PyTorch model
model_analysis = deepview.analyze(TorchModel(your_model))

# Visualize layer activations
model_analysis.visualize_activations()
```

### Interactive Data Visualization
```python
from deepview_canvas import Canvas
from deepview.transforms import UMAP

# Create an interactive visualization with dimensionality reduction
canvas = Canvas(your_dataset)
canvas.add_transform(UMAP())
canvas.add_widget('scatter')
canvas.show()
```

### Custom Widget Creation
```python
from deepview_canvas import Widget

class CustomWidget(Widget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = "custom-viz"
        
    def render(self, data):
        # Custom visualization logic
        pass

canvas.add_widget(CustomWidget())
```
